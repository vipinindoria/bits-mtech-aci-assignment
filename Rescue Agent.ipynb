You cannot pass through river and fire affected area. 10 points to be added when your path passes to adjacent for every fire block. 5 points to be reduced when your path passes to river block. For every transition +3 should be added as step cost. The path which passes through minimum number of squares and minimum points is the shortest and safest path. Squared Euclidian distance can be considered as heuristic value."

    "### Uninformed Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the available information about the problem, the Search Algorithm is first categorized into Uninformed Search Algorithm, which generates the search tree without any domain-specific knowledge or additional information about the states beyond the information provided in the problem definitions. This class-purpose search algorithm, which is also known as Blind Search or Brute-Force Search, operates in a brute-force way and examines each root node of the search tree until it achieves the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements of Uninformed Search:\n",
    "Though Uninformed Search does not require excessive details about the problem, it does have a few search requirements, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **State Description:** States that are reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions as well as details like where the search begins, ends, transition model, etc.  \n",
    "* **A valid set of Operations:** That helps find the most optimal solution with the lowest cost.  \n",
    "* **Initial State:** Information about the stage where the agent first starts the search.  \n",
    "* **Goal State Description:** Details like the limit of the search tree, the sequence of nodes from start to goal, etc. should be considered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components Included in Uninformed Search:\n",
    "In Uninformed Search Algorithms, each of the six search strategies covers the following components, which becomes helpful at a different stage of problem-solving. These components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem Graph:** Contains the start and goal nodes.  \n",
    "* **Strategy:** Describes the manner in which the graph will get to the goal.  \n",
    "* **Fringe:** Includes the data structure used to store all the possible states that can be achieved from the current state.  \n",
    "* **Tree:** It is the result of traversing from the start node to the goal node.  \n",
    "* **Solution Plan:** This is the sequence of nodes from the start to the goal node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Breadth-First Search\n",
    "The most common search strategy, breadth-first search, starts from the root node, explores the neighboring nodes first and moves towards the next level. Implemented using the First-in First-out (FIFO) queue data structure, this is an example of a general-graph search algorithm that provides the shortest path to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a queue to remember to get the next vertex to start a search as well as when a dead end occurs in any iteration. Without this queue, it won’t be able to identify and mark visited vertices and will process them again, which can then become a non-terminating process.  "
