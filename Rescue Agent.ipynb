    "### Uninformed Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the available information about the problem, the Search Algorithm is first categorized into Uninformed Search Algorithm, which generates the search tree without any domain-specific knowledge or additional information about the states beyond the information provided in the problem definitions. This class-purpose search algorithm, which is also known as Blind Search or Brute-Force Search, operates in a brute-force way and examines each root node of the search tree until it achieves the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements of Uninformed Search:\n",
    "Though Uninformed Search does not require excessive details about the problem, it does have a few search requirements, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **State Description:** States that are reachable from the initial state by any sequence of actions as well as details like where the search begins, ends, transition model, etc.  \n",
    "* **A valid set of Operations:** That helps find the most optimal solution with the lowest cost.  \n",
    "* **Initial State:** Information about the stage where the agent first starts the search.  \n",
    "* **Goal State Description:** Details like the limit of the search tree, the sequence of nodes from start to goal, etc. should be considered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components Included in Uninformed Search:\n",
    "In Uninformed Search Algorithms, each of the six search strategies covers the following components, which becomes helpful at a different stage of problem-solving. These components are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem Graph:** Contains the start and goal nodes.  \n",
    "* **Strategy:** Describes the manner in which the graph will get to the goal.  \n",
    "* **Fringe:** Includes the data structure used to store all the possible states that can be achieved from the current state.  \n",
    "* **Tree:** It is the result of traversing from the start node to the goal node.  \n",
    "* **Solution Plan:** This is the sequence of nodes from the start to the goal node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Breadth-First Search\n",
    "The most common search strategy, breadth-first search, starts from the root node, explores the neighboring nodes first and moves towards the next level. Implemented using the First-in First-out (FIFO) queue data structure, this is an example of a general-graph search algorithm that provides the shortest path to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses a queue to remember to get the next vertex to start a search as well as when a dead end occurs in any iteration. Without this queue, it won’t be able to identify and mark visited vertices and will process them again, which can then become a non-terminating process.  "

    "Recursive best-first search is a simple recursive algorithm that improves upon heuristic search by reducing the memory requirement. RBFS uses only linear space and it attempts to mimic the operation of standard best-first search. Its structure is similar to recursive depth-first search but it doesn't continue indefinitely down the current path, the f_limit variable is used to keep track of the f-value of the best alternative path available from any ancestor of the current node. RBFS remembers the f-value of the best leaf in the forgotten subtree and can decide whether it is worth re-expanding the tree later.\n",
