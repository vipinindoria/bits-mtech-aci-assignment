    "Group of peoples were trapped in Kangaroo Island due to sudden Bush Fire. Given below is the picture of a forest as a grid. Due to heavy Bush Fire some of the paths for main entrance are blocked. They are in the position to reach main entrance quickly because of fast spreading of fire. You have a rescue agent to help you find the shortest, quickest and safest route through the\n",

    "No diagonal movements allowed. You cannot pass through river and fire affected area. 10 points to be added when your path passes to adjacent for every fire block. 5 points to be reduced when your path passes to river block. For every transition +3 should be added as step cost. The path which passes through minimum number of squares and minimum points is the shortest and safest path. Squared Euclidian distance can be considered as heuristic value."
